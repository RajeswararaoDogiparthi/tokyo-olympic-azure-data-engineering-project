**Introduction-to-Tools**
Azure Data Factory (ADF): Used for data ingestion, Azure Data Factory allows us to efficiently collect data from various sources and move it to the desired destination. In this project, ADF is responsible for bringing in Olympics data from external sources.

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: This is where the ingested data is stored. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 provides a scalable and secure platform for storing large volumes of data. It enables us to manage, access, and analyze data effectively.

Azure Databricks: For data transformation, we leverage Azure Databricks with PySpark. Databricks provides a collaborative environment for data engineers and data scientists to work together on big data projects. In our project, we use PySpark to clean, reshape, and process the raw Olympics data into a more usable format.

Azure Synapse Analytics: To gain valuable insights from the transformed data, we utilize Azure Synapse Analytics. It allows us to run SQL queries on the data warehouse to extract meaningful information. This is where we uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to the Olympics data.

**About-Project**
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Data Ingestion: Use Azure Data Factory to configure data ingestion from your chosen data sources. Define the data movement and transformation activities required to bring the Olympics data into the Azure ecosystem.

Data Storage: The ingested data will be stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Set up the appropriate folder structure and permissions to organize and secure your data.

Data Transformation: Utilize Azure Databricks with PySpark for data transformation. Cleanse, preprocess, and reshape the data as necessary to prepare it for analysis.

Analytics: Write SQL queries using Azure Synapse Analytics to gain insights from the transformed data. Identify trends, statistics, and patterns related to the Olympics data.
